# Thesis-Code
These are all the files and exact code for research evaluation,
due to free colab resources one or couple of files will crash due to free limits of ram in colab.
For that what you have to do is once it crashes at the bottom left a prompt will apper asking if you want more ram once you click it then you will get more ram and run the code.
It will run without any problem
